Device Tree Bindings for the Arasan SDCHI Controller

  The bindings follow the mmc[1] and the clock bindings[2]. Only deviations are
  documented here.

  [1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt
  [2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Compatibility string. Must be 'arasan,sdhci'
  - reg: From mmc bindings: Register location and length.
  - clocks: From clock bindings: Handles to clock inputs.
  - clock-names: From clock bindings: Tuple including "clk_xin" and "clk_ahb"

Example:
	sdhci@e0100000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci";
		reg = <0xe0100000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&clkc 21>, <&clkc 32>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
	} ;

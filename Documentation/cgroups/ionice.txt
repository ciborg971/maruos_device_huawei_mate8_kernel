Ionice Controller
======================

Overview
--------

Ionice cgroup is used to control processes' io prio value by cgroup, details
please refer to Documentation\block\ioprio.txt

Why don't use blkio cgroup:
1. blkio cgroup is used to control disk I/O R/W weight of processes, it's not
effective for flash storage
2. blkio cgroup depends on CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED,  but other schedulers,
like ROW,  may be used to replace CFQ

User interface
--------------

prio:  processes io priority, signed long type, set by both class and level
       for example, class IOPRIO_CLASS_BE, level 4, value is:
       IOPRIO_CLASS_BE << 13 | 4 = 0x4003 = 16387
       echo 16387 > [ionice cgroup]/prio

class: read only, string type, after writing prio, user can cat it to verify
       class

level: read only, signed long type, after writing prio, user can cat it to verify
       level

Notice
--------------
root group hasn't above interfaces, that means the tasks in root group(by default) io priority won't be affected
parent group and child group has no inherited or restricted relationship,
tasks' io priority in any group only determined by the group prio.

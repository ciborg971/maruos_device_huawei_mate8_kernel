/**
  @brief Calls the registered event handler for the specific event in
  current state.

  This function is the core in the FSM engine everything else is built
  up to support this funtion.

  UFSM_HandleEvent will call the specific event handler that is
  registered to handle the event in the current state. After that it
  will update the state to the return value from the event handler and
  return the new state to the caller. If the event handler calls
  UFSM_Error() or return @ref UFSM_ERROR_STATE it will call the error
  handler.

  If an event handler returns @ref UFSM_ERROR_STATE or a state that
  is outside the state table, UFSM_HandleEvent will call the error handler without
  the second and third parameter and UFSM_GetError() will report zero.

  If the event handler called UFSM_Error() it will end the current
  execution path and call the error handler with the same argument as
  the event handler was called with. UFSM_GetError() will return the the
  second parameter passed to UFSM_Error(). It is recommended that
  the application has unique error values for easier implementation of
  error handling.

  If the event handler returns an state without an event table or if
  the error handler returns @ref UFSM_ERROR_STATE or any state outside
  the event table the FSM will be deleted. And the init/exit handler
  will be called with @ref UFSM_KILL_EVENT as the event.

  UFSM_HandleEvent and all other calls to UFSM takes a pointer to a
  UFSM_Handle_t as input instead of a UFSM_Handle_t. That makes it
  possible for UFSM_Register and UFSM_Kill() to remove the handle from
  the caller. The other APIs do it of consistency reason.

  @code
  UFSM_Handle_t my_life;
  my_life = UFSM_Register (my_FSM_table, MY_BUTT, NULL, "", 0)

  new_state = UFSM_HandleEvent(&my_life, birthday_msg, BIRTHDAY_GREETINGS )
  @endcode

  UFSM_HandleEvent has killed my_life if the new state is a exit
  state, so after the call my_life might be zero.

  @param[in] pstFsm Pointer to a handle from UFSM_Register().
  @param[in] pMsg Argument passed to the event handler. This will be
                  the second parameter passed to the event handler.
  @param[in] swEvent Event to match in the EVENT_ACTION_STRU table for the
             current state.
  @return    New state in the FSM on succesful exit. If the new state
             is an exit state the FSM will be deleted. It is the applications
             responsibility to know if the state is an exit state or not.
             No more calls can be done to and FSM that has been deleted.
             UFSM_EVENT_NOT_HANDLED If there was no handler and no default handler
                                    registered in current state.

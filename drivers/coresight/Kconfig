config HISI_CS
	bool "CoreSight tracing"
	help
	  Enables support for CoreSight tracing. This uses CoreSight trace
	  components and buses to support both hardware (eg. processor ETM)
	  and hardware assisted software instrumentation based (eg. STM)
	  tracing.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here to avoid
	  potential power, performance and memory penalty.

config HISI_CS_STM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	bool "Turn on CoreSight STM tracing by default"
	depends on HISI_CS
	help
	  Turns on CoreSight STM tracing (hardware assisted software
	  instrumentation based tracing) by default. Otherwise, tracing is
	  disabled by default but can be enabled via sysfs.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here to avoid
	  potential power, performance and memory penalty.

config HISI_CS_ETM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	bool "Turn on CoreSight ETM tracing by default"
	depends on HISI_CS
	help
	  Turns on CoreSight ETM tracing (processor tracing) by default.
	  Otherwise, tracing is disabled by default but can be enabled via
	  sysfs.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here to avoid
	  potential power, performance and memory penalty.

config HISI_CS_ETM_PCSAVE_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	bool "Turn on PC saving by default"
	depends on HISI_CS
	help
	  Turns on program counter saving on reset by default. Otherwise,
	  PC saving is disabled by default but can be enabled via sysfs.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here to avoid
	  potential power penalty.

config CONTROL_TRACE
	tristate "Turn on to control tracing"
	help
	  Builds module to abort tracing on a user space data, instruction
	  or prefetch abort.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here to avoid
	  potential power, performance and memory penalty.
